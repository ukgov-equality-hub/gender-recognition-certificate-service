                Once you’ve sent your documents, your application will be reviewed by the Gender Recognition Panel.
                This usually happens within 22 weeks of you applying.

                We will let you know if your application has any errors or missing documents, or if the Panel needs any

            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                You will then be told if you will be issued with a Gender Recognition Certificate,
                and what you can do if your application has not been accepted.
