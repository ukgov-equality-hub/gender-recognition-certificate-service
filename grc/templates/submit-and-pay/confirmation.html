                Your application will be reviewed by the Gender Recognition Panel.
                This usually happens within 30 weeks of you applying.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                We will let you know if your application has any errors or missing documents, or if the Panel needs any
                more information. We will ensure you have the time you need to provide any missing or additional information.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                You will then be told if you will be issued with a Gender Recognition Certificate,
                and what you can do if your application has not been accepted.
